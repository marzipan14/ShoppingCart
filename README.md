My take on https://rubygem.me/2014/01/16/shopping-cart-kata/

Implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items. Goods are priced individually, however there are weekly special offers for when multiple items are bought. For example “Apples are 50 each or 3 for 130”.
